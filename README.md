Slides + links for my presentation, Versioning and Maintaining Your REST API in ASP.NET Core

## Abstract

When tasked with making a REST API for your system, you'll inevitably have to think about versioning. One of the most difficult parts of API maintenance, versioning is an essential conversation to have about the future of your API, even before you hit File -> New Project. Do you version in the URL (v1/api/whatever)? Do you use header versioning? Should I update my production API in place?
 
 In this session, Spencer will provide several strategies and real world examples of API versioning done right... and wrong. We'll discuss versioning strategies such as header versioning and URL versioning, as well as best practices on how to intelligently version your REST API without tearing your hair out... or making your consumers tear their hair out.
